Added Straw Hat (3- Star)
Added Accessory Trunk (4-Star)
Rebalanced some item pools
Gumball Machine now takes 4 charges
Increased Gumball Machine's Super Candy chance to 20%
For Modders: Centralized the item pools so modifying items and item pools at runtime is much easier

Slightly decreased the speed of the Golf Balls in the Fairway Fiend boss fight on later floors
The realtime boss fight intro cutscenes are now skippable
[TITLE]Tweaks
It is no longer possible to reroll a specific Cog Task into another specific Cog Task
Added a keybind for ending your turn
[TITLE]Bugfixes
Fixed a bug where the status effects panel wouldn't expand when a Cog has over 8 status effects
Fixed a bug where skyboxes would stick around if you exited a floor using White-Out
Fixed a bug where using White-Out on the Ground Floor would allow level 3 Cogs to spawn on the repeated floor
Fixed some issues where lava pits wouldn't teleport you out if you were invincible
Potentially fixed a rare bug where the D.A. Office Elevator camera would take over the screen when spawned in
Also, made the \"I'm Stuck\" button refocus the Player camera as a failsafe for any additional camera shenanigans
Definitely and for real this time fixed the issue where the Paint Silo elevator wouldn't spawn in the right place
Major text fixes
[TITLE]Hotfix #1
Made Fire Hydrant's animation a little snappier
Fixed a bug that caused Accessory Trunk to occasionally spawn Laff Boosts & Gag Frames
Paint Bucket should no longer be able to reroll an item into the same item
Wizard Hat will no longer retarget Gags targeting v2.0 Cogs
Fixed a bug where Mini Blinds would not properly reassert the main target of a Gag
Mini Blinds can no longer upgrade $10 Dollar Bill to Presentation
The paint streams in the Paint Silo boss can no longer damage you during invincibility frames
Slightly increased the press range of the buttons in the Golden Goose boss fight
Hopefully fixed the long standing issue of getting stuck on treasure chests
Shapes spawning 3 in a row in the \"Drag three of a color in a row\" puzzle will now clear automatically"
